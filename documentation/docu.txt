    <thread>
    
        -each thread will handle a dimension, number line(1 thread), cordinate plane(2 threads), 3d space(3 threads)
        -thread will call, function that calculatesa than outputs a direction to a dynamic array structure
        
    
    
     
    algorithmic process
    
        -a thread is created, than it will generate a random number and than add it to a variable
            - once thread process is completed than record into a cordinate object node
            
            
    exceptions
    
        runtime
        
            - acessing a nullptr
            - seg fault of improper buffer use
